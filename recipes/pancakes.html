    <h6>This is the best pancakes recipe there is!</h6>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick,</p>
    <p>fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably</p>
    <p>already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in</p>
        <p>the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the</p>
            <p>batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook</p>
            <p>until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook</p>
            <p>until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
